Create two terminals

Frontend:
Run the following commands
`cd frontend`

`nodemon`

Note that you will need to create an .env file with the following information in the backend folder:
`DB_USER=`
`DB_PASS=`

`BACKEND_PORT=`

You will also need to be connected to the VPN in order for the backend server to properly start
